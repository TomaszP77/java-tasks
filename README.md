# java-tasks

This project presents tasks with solutions from the basics of the Java software language.

Technologies
Project is created with:

* Java 18
* Gradle

#### 1.
    - Declare a double variable equal to 50
    - Declare a second double variable equal to 30
    - Sum both variables and then multiply by 30
    - Divide the obtained value by 70
    - If the remainder of the division is greater than 15, write an appropriate message on the screen

#### 2.
    Three values are given:
        a = 10
        b = 20
        condition = true
    Write the code that, when a and b are positive and condition = false, will print the word "Tester",
       and otherwise "Automatic"

#### 3.
    Write code (in the main method) that prints information about the time of year depending on the given month.
    Use the Switch statement

#### 4.
    Write code (in the main method) to check whether the given year is a leap year.
    Tip: A leap year meets one of the following conditions
    - is divisible by 4, but at the same time not divisible by 100
    - is divisible by 400
    
    * Please check some examples: e.g. 2018; 1600
    * Your code should work for years in the range 1 - 9999;

#### 5.
    Write a method that returns the number of days in a given month. The method should
    accept two arguments:
    - month number
    - year

#### 6.
    Use the code from the previous task to return the correct number of days in
    February.

#### 7.
    Write a program that will display consecutive natural numbers from 1 to 10 on the screen in three different loops: 
    while, do-while and for.
    Additionally, for each number, the program should display information whether the number is even or odd.

#### 8.
    Write a program that checks whether a number is divisible by 5.

#### 9.
    Write a program that reverses the order of words received from the user.

#### 10.
    Write a lottery program in which the user must enter a number from 1 to 10.
    If the number is the same as the number randomly selected by the program, the user wins $1,000.

#### 11.
    Write a program that receives two integers from the user and performs basic mathematical operations on them:
    - adding
    - subtraction
    - multiplication
    - division
    - the remainder from division

#### 12.
    Rework the previous task to create a separate "Basic Mathematical Operations" class with 5 methods:
    -addition
    -subtraction
    -multiplication
    -division
    -the remainder from division.

    Then create an object of the "Basic Mathematical Operations" class and call all the methods in the appropriate place in the code.
