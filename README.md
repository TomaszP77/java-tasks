# java-tasks

This project presents tasks with solutions from the basics of the Java software language.

Technologies
Project is created with:

* Java 18
* Gradle

#### 1.
    - Declare a double variable equal to 50
    - Declare a second double variable equal to 30
    - Sum both variables and then multiply by 30
    - Divide the obtained value by 70
    - If the remainder of the division is greater than 15, write an appropriate message on the screen

#### 2.
    Three values are given:
        a = 10
        b = 20
        condition = true
    Write the code that, when a and b are positive and condition = false, will print the word "Tester",
       and otherwise "Automatic"

#### 3.
    Write code (in the main method) that prints information about the time of year depending on the given month.
    Use the Switch statement

#### 4.
    Write code (in the main method) to check whether the given year is a leap year.
    Tip: A leap year meets one of the following conditions
    - is divisible by 4, but at the same time not divisible by 100
    - is divisible by 400
    
    * Please check some examples: e.g. 2018; 1600
    * Your code should work for years in the range 1 - 9999;

#### 5.
    Write a method that returns the number of days in a given month. The method should
    accept two arguments:
    - month number
    - year

#### 6.
    Use the code from the previous task to return the correct number of days in
    February.
